# Curriculum & Talent Intelligence Platform (CTIP)

## 🧠 Overview

EdTech companies operating in fast‑evolving technology domains face a persistent **mismatch between their industry‑aligned curriculum and current job‑market trends**. While employers rapidly adopt new tools, frameworks, and workflows, EdTech curricula are often slow to update. Instructors may lag in adopting these changes due to limited upskilling time, narrow specialization, or lack of immediate institutional support.

This creates a cascading operational challenge for EdTech platforms:

* Learners are trained on partially outdated skill sets
* Placement outcomes decline
* New technologies take longer to reach classrooms

CTIP is purpose‑built for **EdTech companies** to solve this problem end‑to‑end. It introduces a **data‑grounded, RAG‑based intelligence layer** that continuously aligns curriculum with real job‑market demand. Beyond curriculum updates, CTIP uniquely evaluates **internal instructor readiness** and, when no qualified instructor exists internally, generates **hiring intelligence to onboard industry professionals** capable of teaching the updated content.

Rather than treating curriculum design and instructor hiring as separate workflows, CTIP unifies them into a single, evidence‑driven system tailored specifically for EdTech operations.

> *“We don’t just update what EdTech companies teach — we ensure they have the right talent to teach it.”*

## ❗ Problem Statement

### Curriculum–Talent Mismatch in Fast-Evolving Job Markets

Modern job roles evolve rapidly, but curriculum updates and instructor hiring processes lag behind. Institutions face two connected challenges:

### 1️⃣ Curriculum Drift

* Curricula are updated infrequently and manually
* Updates rely on intuition rather than job-market evidence
* Graduates are often underprepared for current roles

### 2️⃣ Instructor Supply Gap

* New skills require new teaching capability
* Instructor hiring is reactive and disconnected from curriculum changes
* No system links **job demand → curriculum change → instructor readiness**

### Impact

* Lower placement rates
* Inconsistent teaching quality
* Delayed adoption of modern technologies
* High operational risk for EdTech companies
